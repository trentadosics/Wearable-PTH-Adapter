# Wearable-PTH-Adapter
Wearable project (supported by FAB-Casa del Mig, Barcelona) - June 2025

Supported by: FAB - Casa del Mig (Barcelona; Oriol Blas, Ricard GÃ³mez and Dimecres FAB community)

## Description
This project aims to support the mounting and testing of wearable devices on protoboards.  

Firstly, it began as a personal challenge on August 2022, to improve the testing of electronic circuits with wearable components on protoboards.  

Secondly, on September 2022 I have agreed with FAB-Casa del Mig to develop an easy-to-use product that can be used in both their introductory and advanced wearable workshops, offering participants a friendly experience in testing wearable electronics.

Thirdly, it is intended to be an open project designed to help any maker with their wearable circuits, as well as to improve the current version based on feedback from the maker community.

Finally, this repository will include the final version and all earlier ones as soon as possible, as well as future modifications.
