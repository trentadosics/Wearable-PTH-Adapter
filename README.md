# Wearable-PTH-Adapter
Wearable project (supported by FAB-Casa del Mig, Barcelona) - June 2025

Supported by: FAB - Casa del Mig (Barcelona; Oriol Blas, Ricard GÃ³mez and Dimecres FAB community)

## Description
This project aims to support the mounting and testing of wearable devices on protoboards.  

Firstly, it began as a personal challenge to improve the testing of electronic circuits with wearable components on protoboards.  

Secondly, the goal is to create an easy-to-use product that can be used in basic wearable workshops at FAB-Casa del Mig, providing a friendly first experience with electronics through circuit and device testing.
